# Dynamic Pricing Engine for Urban Parking Lots

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project develops an **intelligent, data-driven dynamic pricing engine** for urban parking lots. Our primary goal is to optimize parking space utilization and revenue by adjusting prices in real-time based on predicted demand. Traditional static pricing models often lead to inefficiencies, like overcrowding during peak hours or underutilization during off-peak times. This system leverages **machine learning** and **real-time stream processing** to create a responsive, dynamic pricing strategy.

At its core, the project utilizes an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model**, trained on historical parking data, to forecast future occupancy rates. This prediction then feeds into a rule-based pricing engine that calculates an optimal price. The entire workflow is orchestrated within a **real-time streaming pipeline**, simulating how the system would operate in a live environment.
